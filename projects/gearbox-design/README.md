# Gearbox Design and Analysis

## Context
Designed and analysed a two-stage spur gear reduction gearbox to meet specified speed and power requirements.

## Requirements
- Input speed and power defined by the unit brief  
- Target output speed and torque  
- Designed for reliability and manufacturability

## My role
I developed the design from concept to final documentation, including gear selection, shaft sizing, stress checks, and drawings.

## Engineering approach
- Chose gear ratios and layout to meet the reduction requirement  
- Calculated torque at each stage and sized components accordingly  
- Checked bending and fatigue stresses for shafts and key interfaces  
- Selected appropriate materials and fits  
- Produced CAD model and compliant engineering drawings

## Evidence

- Key calculations: [add here]
- Final drawings: [add here]

## Outcome
A complete gearbox design supported by calculations and professional documentation.
