## Context
Delivered 2500+ residential and commercial AV installations with a focus on safe mounting, quality workmanship, and client handover. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## What this demonstrates
- Practical problem solving on real sites
- Safety awareness and risk control
- Diagnosing issues with unknown constraints
- Clear client communication and professional handover

## Case study template (I will add multiple)
### Case study 1 – [Short title]
**Situation:**  
**Constraints:** wall type, stud spacing, cable path, time, aesthetics, safety  
**Actions:** how I assessed the wall, chose fixings, managed risk, completed install  
**Result:** outcome, client feedback, no callbacks, lessons learned  

## Evidence I will add
- Photos with sensitive details removed
- Before/after
- Tools and fixings used (general, not brand-critical)
- Safety checks and handover steps
